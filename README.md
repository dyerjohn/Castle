I have an old printout from an unknown date of Castle with notes.
Some notes are my hand writing some are Dave's.

The printout is on "Tomato paper" from Chef Boyardee, Milton PA, when Dave and Ed had a summer adventure.
Because this is 17 X 11 green bar, my guess is that this was printed on the Epson MX-100 printer I got while working in Towanda.
That places the printout date to roughly fall of 1981
